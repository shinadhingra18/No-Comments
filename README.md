## Introduction

No Comments is a project being developed under the [Mozilla Open Leaders Program](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/) and mentored by [Pranshu Khanna.](https://github.com/pransh15)

We are working with designers and developers to create IDE plug-ins for students and budding developers that will convert your sorce code into a flow chart at real time. The aim of this project is to create a better navigation of your code, to make the manually entered comments more efficient and to give students the confidence to code anything and everything!

## Why are we doing it?

* Lack of relative visual logic to the code a newbie developer writes to practice.
* Collaborative lapses in organizations due to unthorough comments.

## How are we doing it?

* Using flowcharts!! Yes, that's right. ü§ò

* Transitioning from textbook to code doesn't pan out well for most students since they can't relate to it very often. 
  This can help them understand how their chunk of code puts together a logic in real time and the output they expect to create.
  
* Creating a navigational flowchart helps understand a developer about how others' code connects with theirs in a collaborative environment.

## What do we need?

No Comments aims to create a plug-in for [Atom](https://atom.io/), it is a free and open-source text and source code editor. A plug-in that would convert a code into a SVG flowchart in real time. 
We will start with focusing on one language but would want this plug-in to be expanded and support multiple coding languages in the future.
We would need developers and contributors to who can drive this forward and create such plug-ins in Atom.
