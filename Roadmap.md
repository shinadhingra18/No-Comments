# Roadmap


I am working with designers and developers to build a IDE plugin for students and budding developers that will convert a source code into a flow chart at real time to create a new navigation standard for a better visualization and understanding of code. 

This is the first draft of our roadmap to complete the project under Cohort 7 of Mozilla Open Leaders Program. More Milestones will be added later as we progress through this program. 

Check out the different milestones listed below.

### Milestone 0 : Make it contributor friendly
- [x] Include README.md
- [x] Include Code of Conduct
- [x] Include Participation Guidelines

### Milestone 1 : Code Prototype
Create a code prototype to test if it works at real time and the accuracy of the conversion from code to flowchart.

### Milestone 2 : Flowchart Design
Create a design for the output which is the flowchart visualization of the code of the developer.
